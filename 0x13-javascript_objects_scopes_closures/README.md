JavaScript - Objects, Scopes and Closure

Object basics
An object is a collection of related data and/or functionality. These usually consist of several variables and functions (which are called properties and methods when they are inside objects). Let's work through an example to understand what they look like.

To begin with, make a local copy of our oojs.html file. This contains very little â€” a <script> element for us to write our source code into. We'll use this as a basis for exploring basic object syntax. While working with this example you should have your developer tools JavaScript console open and ready to type in some commands.

As with many things in JavaScript, creating an object often begins with defining and initializing a variable. Try entering the following line below the JavaScript code that's already in your file, then saving and refreshing:

const person = {};
Copy to Clipboard
Now open your browser's JavaScript console, enter person into it, and press Enter/Return. You should get a result similar to one of the below lines:

[object Object]
Object { }
{ }
